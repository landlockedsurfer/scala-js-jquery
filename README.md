scala-js-jquery
===============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scala-js/scala-js-jquery.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scala-js/scala-js-jquery)
[![Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/assets/badges/scalajs-0.6.13.svg)](https://www.scala-js.org/)

Static types for the jQuery API for [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/) programs.

Usage
-----

Add the following to your sbt build definition:

    libraryDependencies += "be.doeraene" %%% "scalajs-jquery" % "0.9.1"

then enjoy the types available in `org.scalajs.jquery`.

scalajs-jquery 0.9.1 is built and published for Scala.js 0.6.13 and later, with
Scala 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12.

Include JavaScript
------------------

scala-js-jquery provides the types, not the `jquery.js` file itself.
If you want it to be included in the final `client-jsdeps.js`, you can add the desired version to `jsDependencies`, e.g.,

    jsDependencies +=
      "org.webjars" % "jquery" % "2.1.3" / "2.1.3/jquery.js"

Using [Scala.js Bundler](https://scalacenter.github.io/scalajs-bundler)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to use Scala.js Bundler (sbt plugin must be enabled in `project/plugins.sbt`) to import jQuery as npm module, then add the following lines to your sbt build definition:

```
enablePlugins(ScalaJSBundlerPlugin)

libraryDependencies += "be.doeraene" %%% "scalajs-jquery" % "0.9.1"

npmDependencies in Compile ++= Seq(
 Â "jquery" -> "2.1.3"
)
```

Next define a `jquery` object in your Scala code using the `@JSImport` annotation to get access to the exported `jQuery` object.
A simple example on how to use the Scala.js JQuery facade this way is shown here:

```
import org.scalajs.jquery.JQueryStatic
import scala.scalajs.js
import scala.scalajs.js.annotation.JSImport

@js.native
@JSImport("jquery", JSImport.Namespace)
object jquery extends JQueryStatic

object Main extends js.JSApp {
  @js.annotation.JSExport
  override def main(): Unit = {
    jquery("body").html("Hello world!")
  }
}
```

Running the sbt task `fastOptJS::webpack` will generate a JavaScript bundle (`...-fastopt-bundle.js`) including jquery as specified in the `npmDependencies` sbt build definition setting.
